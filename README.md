# Threading

Preemptive multithreading kernel with time-sharing.

Implemented using system stack for kernel calls.
This solves performance problems and synchronization issues.
Test classes are included.

Great care was given to system design, therefore source code is easy to read and can be used for learning.

Contact me if you have any questions.
This is fun, but not so easy.
